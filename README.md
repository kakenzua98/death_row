# Sentiment Analysis of Executed Death Row Inmates

### Topic
This is an analysis of the Last Statement of Death Row Inmates (henceforth referred to as "the subjects") Executed in Texas from 1988 to 2018. The analysis includes trends in executions in the United States over the past 40 years and sentiment analysis on the Last Statements.  

### Motivation
I came across two articles in Medium (https://medium.com/bigger-picture/kill-the-death-penalty-ea38c8929e30 and https://medium.com/s/story/love-is-the-most-common-word-in-death-row-last-statements-f15ab0e8ad16). The former discussed reasons why the death penalty should be abolished and the latter conducted some sentiment analysis on the released statements of the subjects in Texas. I did not have any particular hypotheses going into the project. I was simply very curious to read and analyse these transcripts. I wanted to see how much Texas was executing death row inmates compared to it's counterparts, what was the breakdown of sentiments in the subjects' statements, and if there were any trends in sentiment with respect to age, year, or race. Lastly, I wanted to give people a closer look into the final moments of people executed yearly in Texas. 

### Background Info and Sources
I gathered most of my data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html) and the Death Penalty Information Center's execution database (https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/views-executions). 

### Summary
As shown on the 'Why Texas?' tab, I found that Texas conducted nearly half of the death row executions nationwide in 2018. Though executions have decreased since 1999, Texas has maintained a large margin of the total executions and now, as stated, conducted the majority of them. Additionally, though 31 states have not outlawed the death penalty, less than 10 actually conducted any executions thsi year. This reaffirms some of the statements made in the Medium articles that discuss death penalty being more of a de factor life sentence in most states. 

Sentiment Analysis begins on the Most Common Words tab which shows that a majority of the words in Last Statements are connote positivity and/or trust. The word cloud below shows that one of the most common words in Last Statements by the subjects was the word "good" with 55 entries.

The time plot is inconclusive. However, it does show that the percentage of positive words used has increased at a higher rate than the percentage of negative words used. 

### Takeaway
I'd like the primary takeway from this project to be awareness of the rampant executions in Texas and to give a small voice to the last words of the inmates.
